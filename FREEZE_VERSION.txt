Freeze Version 3
Timestamp: 2026-02-20 13:03:05

Scope:
- Bullet maturity cashflow structure
- Correlated macro factor (Z) driving default, LGD, margin shock
- Market-freeze liquidity regime (Markov persistence)
- Refinancing cliff at maturity with stress-dependent refinance failure + haircut (liquidity tail)
- Auto artifacts each run:
  * outputs/<run_id>/mc_results.csv
  * outputs/<run_id>/config_snapshot.json
  * outputs/<run_id>/figures/*.png (NI, tail NI, equity return, sensitivity, credit-vs-liquidity)
  * outputs/<run_id>/figures/tail_decomposition.csv
  * outputs/<run_id>/report.pdf

Acceptance:
- Reproducibility confirmed with seed=42 (signatures match across runs)
- PDF layout rescaled (no overflow) + table fits margin
